        Let's face it. Hackernews isn't the most accessible to readers and the visually impaired.
      </p>
      <p>
        So I built this: a front page that is more readable for those of us who have less than perfect eyesite.
      </p>
      <p>
        It's static HTML, uses divs instead of tables, and has few aesthetic choices that get in the way of readability.
