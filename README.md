# Just the Links

A more accessible Hackernews front page.

Let's face it. Hackernews isn't the most accessible to readers and the visually impaired.

So I built this: a front page that is more readable for those who have less than perfect eyesite.

It's static HTML, uses divs instead of tables, and has few aesthetic choices that get in the way of readability.
